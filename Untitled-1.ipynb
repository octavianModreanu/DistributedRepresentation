    "    Okay so my main thing right now is that i don't know where to go from here. I have the basic\n",
    "    functionalities of a graph, and i think what i need right now is to set up the weights between different nodes\n",
    "    but before i do that i need to set up an example graph that i can use to test stuff.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The thing is with that is that the entry to this whole thing should set up a node which connects the category nodes with it\n",
    "    I should do that first so it will look something of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Entry field: Sam 20 Burglar single Shark HighSchool    \n",
    "\n",
    "            input = entry.get().split(\" \")\n",
    "            \n",
    "             recognise_and_add_node_to_categories(input)    # This function should categorise the input taken into distinct categories and then add the nodes to the graph\n",
    "                                                                # The program knows where to put these things based on training\n",
    "\n",
    "             add_node(person)       # as of now i cannot just add more than one node with a similar name\n",
    "                                        #but i think that's an easy problem to solve\n",
    "             for _ in input\n",
    "                if _ is in net\n",
    "                    add_conn(person, _)\n",
    "                    \n",
    "    This is the point where weights would come in as well, the connections with the person nodes and weights would be excitatory\n",
    "    and would start from wij = 0.1 (which is the amount of which unit j (sending) influences unit i(receiving)) giving the following\n",
    "    activation formula: inputij = aj x wij\n",
    "    \n",
    "    But I also need to set up the activation of the nodes which would get called each time one of the category nodes are activated\n",
    "    by the entry field.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The inhibitory connections should also be established. Any nodes with the same attribute should set up an inhibitory connection\n",
    "    between them\n",
    "    \n",

    "    So there’s migration to be done, what else\n",
    "\n",
    "    The prediction is about 80% of the time correct, it’s not exactly right but so far I’ve implemented different models separately.\n",
    "    I could integrate them into a formula and tweak it until it gets them right maybe I get some good results that way. \n",
    "\n",
    "    But if that doesn’t work out, I could go all crazy and implement a DNN, but the code is already overly complicated I think that would make it more so. \n",
    "    Plus, I want to get back into coding the actual thing rather than a bloody categoriser which already ate up a lot of my time. \n",
    "    It’s cool and taught me things but I just want to get back at the app. \n",
    "    If the integration doesn’t work out, I might just leave it as it is whatevs it’s just a personal project. \n",
    "    This is sunk cost effect but I put too much effort to just add a dropdown or a pop-up for each new added node (which I might do if I’ll eventually want a finished app)\n",
    "\n",
    "    === APP ===\n",
    "\n",
    "    So for now I have the activation of the nodes but the activation of the nodes. This is great for the training phase as weights get adjusted,\n",
    "    but there are some issues with it:\n",
    "    -> the second layer transmits activation back to the previous layer\n",
    "        - This is by design since im using this activation feature to make a database where I need them to communicate with each other\n",
    "            - It can be a problem if I want to take this and make a DNN\n",
    "\n",
    "    NOTES: The training phase is also rather primitive. Activation functions are binary and weights are linear. \n",
    "\n",
    "    -> I still haven’t figured out how the recall phase will look like. It’d be nice if I would have a proper example and start testing.\n",
    "    I have the example, but I haven’t done the testing with the new activation features I have so maybe that’s the next step after migration\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Migration comes first, and that’s going to take me a few sessions since I need to understand what’s going on over there. \n",
    "    Then comes recall phase after training. That’s good enough for an initial prototype so I can implement non-linear weights and \n",
    "    (maybe) sigmoid activation functions. If the categorisation issues are too annoying I’ll just add a pop-up to add the new category \n",
    "    or implement a DNN why the fuck not. If I’m done with the app I might as well learn something new.\n",
