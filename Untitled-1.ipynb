    "    Okay so my main thing right now is that i don't know where to go from here. I have the basic\n",
    "    functionalities of a graph, and i think what i need right now is to set up the weights between different nodes\n",
    "    but before i do that i need to set up an example graph that i can use to test stuff.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The thing is with that is that the entry to this whole thing should set up a node which connects the category nodes with it\n",
    "    I should do that first so it will look something of the following:\n",

    "        Entry field: Sam 20 Burglar single Shark HighSchool    \n",
