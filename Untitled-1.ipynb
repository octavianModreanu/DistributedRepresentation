    "    Okay so my main thing right now is that i don't know where to go from here. I have the basic\n",
    "    functionalities of a graph, and i think what i need right now is to set up the weights between different nodes\n",
    "    but before i do that i need to set up an example graph that i can use to test stuff.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The thing is with that is that the entry to this whole thing should set up a node which connects the category nodes with it\n",
    "    I should do that first so it will look something of the following:\n",

    "        Entry field: Sam 20 Burglar single Shark HighSchool    \n",

    "            input = entry.get().split(\" \")\n",

    "    activation formula: inputij = aj x wij\n",
    "    \n",
    "    But I also need to set up the activation of the nodes which would get called each time one of the category nodes are activated\n",
    "    by the entry field.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The inhibitory connections should also be established. Any nodes with the same attribute should set up an inhibitory connection\n",

    "    Idk how to do this tbh. for now, i got a way to represent nodes and connections through matrices and lists but i don't really know\n",
    "    where to go from here. I mean they should get activated whenever there's a mention of the node in the entry field. They should connect\n",
    "    to each other, and if there's no node, there should be one while expanding the connections matrix. \n",
    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "Done with activations but now i need to clear up what am i going do in regards to training / recall. Right now i got the bare bones\n",
